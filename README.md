# Renzu Homebrew Tap

This repository is a Homebrew "tap" that provides formulae that exist only to depend on the Homebrew packages we need.

By using this tap you can stay up to date with our dependencies easily.

## Setup

```bash
brew tap renzuinc/workstation
brew install renzuinc/workstation/everything
```

## Keeping Up to Date

Just keep up to date with Homebrew as you normally would:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade
```
